Looks like we've hit the end of the road.
... now what?
Crap.
Did you do this?
It's not my fault!
I'm innocent.
This can't be happening!
What have you done?
I'm blaming this on you!
I blame JavaScript.
I blame poor documentation.
I blame this on Windows.
I blame Linux.
Dammit, Blake! You had one job!
You did this!
I can make up for it.
I'm sorry.
An error occured whilst displaying this error.
Can we come to an agreement?
We can just blame it on quantum physics.
We can just blame it on Obama.
Ow, that hurt.
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.
Hi. I'm zBot, and I'm a crashaholic.
Can we try not to do that?
This is all planned.
This was supposed to happen, I swear!
I'll give you $10 if you keep it on the low.
What just happened?
What went wrong?
Everything was going so well...
This doesn't make any sense!
I'm sad now :(
Please call technical support.
I really need to stop doing that...
I'm just an innocent bot, man!
I honestly didn't mean to do that.
Whoops.
Whoa.
Woah.
Why?!
That was weird...
Whoops. My mistake.
I can't believe you've done this.
That wasn't intended.
I thought I fixed this!
Something cool was supposed to happen, not this!
Oof, that didn't go right.
That wasn't supposed to happen...
Why'd that happen?
Everybody stay calm!
I was having such a good day until this.
I'm going down!
Man down, man down!
I'm wounded!
I've been shot!
Send backup, I repeat, send backup!
Is there a doctor anywhere?
Ridiculous.
This is an emergency.
Someone call an ambulance!
Score 500 or sacrifice child.
I'm done.
Stop that!
:thinking:
Come on.
GOD!
