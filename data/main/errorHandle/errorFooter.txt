Don't fret!
Don't worry!
Don't freak out!
Don't panic!
Don't have a heart attack!
Don't hyperventilate!
Don't die!
Don't get scared!
Don't scream!
Don't get angry!
Don't start breaking stuff!
Don't break anything!
Stop, drop and roll.
Why panic?
No need to worry.
No need to panic.
Just relax.
Just grab a drink and sit back.
No need to stress yourself.
We'll get this sorted out.
Sorry about that!
That was silly.
Oops!
Gah!
Ahh!
Oh no!
Anyways.
Regardless.
Well, that was bad.
Well, that was interesting.
Well, that didn't turn out too well.
