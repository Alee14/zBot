# zBot
zBot is a highly advanced, mutli-purpose bot that can be used for moderation, games, profile customization and more!

...or at least it **was**.
After running for over an entire year, with one main developer and 5 other contributors (as well as some extra help from others), zBot is being discontinued on the **20th of July, 2018**.
This source code is purely for archival reasons. This code is not intended to be self-hosted or ran by anyone.
I mean, you can **try**, but you probably won't get very far.

You can find out more information about the discontinuation of zBot [at the website](https://zbot.me).
Thank you for using zBot, I hope you enjoy this archive of code.

PS. If you think my code sucks, good for you. Some of the code here isn't perfect, and I'm ready to admit that.
It wasn't intended to be shown to other people. But, since zBot is being discontinued, I thought "why not?".
This was my very first JavaScript project, and I've learned so much about JavaScript and programming in general from it that I am proud of the progress I made and I'm extremely proud of what I've created.
